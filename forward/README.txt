Each python file generates the images in the corresponding folder

sim.py
For the analysis spreadsheet, each folder was then run by commenting/uncommenting the corresponding line with folder name and numImgs in sim.py
* "- normalized" indicates that the mean of the image was subtracted from each image, the non-normalized is simulated in the simPreNormalized.py function

simPerm.py
Used to generated "permutation" graphs, a comparison of different image types
